# SeniorProject
This was a project done for my Senior Capstone project. Our goal was to create a web vr experience that would run regardless of 
platform. Myself and a group of 2 others used the A-Frame framework to achieve this goal. I was tasked with doing most of the
javascript scripting and sound design.

This was my first project using javascript. There was admittedly a bit of a learning curve. The resources at the time for A-Frame
were slim and I had to learn through trial and error and a few udemy courses. It was messy but we were able to finish the project.
